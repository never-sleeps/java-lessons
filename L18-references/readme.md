#### Types of References in Java.

1. Strong reference - This is the default type/class of Reference Object. Any object which has an active strong reference are not eligible for garbage collection. The object is garbage collected only when the variable which was strongly referenced points to null.  ```MyClass obj = new MyClass ();```
2. java.lang.ref.WeakReference - A weakly referenced object is cleared by the Garbage Collector when it's weakly reachable. Weak reachability means that an object has neither strong nor soft references pointing to it. The object can be reached only by traversing a weak reference.  ```WeakReference weakCounter = new WeakReference(counter);```
3. java.lang.ref.SoftReference - In Soft reference, even if the object is free for garbage collection then also its not garbage collected, until JVM is in need of memory badly.The objects gets cleared from the memory when JVM runs out of memory.  ```SoftReference<Gfg> softref = new SoftReference<Gfg>(g);```
4. java.lang.ref.PhantomReference - The objects which are being referenced by phantom references are eligible for garbage collection. But, before removing them from the memory, JVM puts them in a queue called ‘reference queue’ . They are put in a reference queue after calling finalize() method on them.  ``` ReferenceQueue<Gfg> refQueue = new ReferenceQueue<Gfg>();  PhantomReference<Gfg> phantomRef = new PhantomReference<Gfg>(g,refQueue);```
